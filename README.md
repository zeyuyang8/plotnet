# PlotNet

## Overview

PlotNet, inspired by the [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/), is a package of visualizing the architecture of multi-layer perceptrons.

- Here is an [example animation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rcqvnbi2thicmd8/Neural%20network%20architeture%20animation%20-%20spiral.html?dl=0) of the training process of a multi-layer perceptron.
- The corresponding notebook can be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1llqNm1V5Z1GrqCLTmdsMk3ZKgdvcpcWD?usp=sharing) and run in Google Colab.
