# PlotNet

PlotNet, inspired by the [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/), allows for visualizing the structure and training proecess of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). The MLPs are implemented in PyTorch and the visualizations are generated by Plotly. The figure below shows an example plot of the MLP architecture. The animation of a multi-layer perceptron's training process on a spiral dataset is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rcqvnbi2thicmd8/Neural%20network%20architeture%20animation%20-%20spiral.html?dl=0). To create new visualizations, access the [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1llqNm1V5Z1GrqCLTmdsMk3ZKgdvcpcWD?usp=sharing) and execute it in Google Colab.
